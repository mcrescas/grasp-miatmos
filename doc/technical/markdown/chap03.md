Chapter 3: Grasp-manager for developers {#chap03}
=======================================

grasp-manager is a script placed in the root folder of grasp. It contains useful tools
for users, explained in the user documentation (section in progress), but it also contains
many useful tools to help developers. GRASP code is organized in many repositories
and this tool will help to keep all of them synchronized: changing branches,
pushing them to remote server, etc. at the same time.

[ Section in progress: all actions which can be done by grasp-manager for developers, should
be documented here ]
